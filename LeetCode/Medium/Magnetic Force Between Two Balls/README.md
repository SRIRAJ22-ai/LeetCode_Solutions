## Problem Description

<p>In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has <code>n</code> empty baskets, the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> basket is at <code>position[i]</code>, Morty has <code>m</code> balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the <strong>minimum magnetic force</strong> between any two balls is <strong>maximum</strong>.</p>

<p>Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is <code>|x - y|</code>.</p>

<p>Given the integer array <code>position</code> and the integer <code>m</code>. Return <em>the required force</em>.</p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem is to distribute `m` balls into `n` baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximized. The magnetic force between two balls at positions `x` and `y` is defined as `|x - y|`.

This can be approached as a maximization problem where we want to find the largest possible minimum distance between any two balls. Binary search is a suitable technique for this type of optimization problem because it allows us to efficiently explore the range of possible minimum distances.


# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. **Sorting**:
   - First, we sort the array of basket positions. This helps us to efficiently check the possible placement of balls in increasing order of positions.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - We perform binary search on the possible values of the minimum distance (`dist`) between two balls.
   - The lower bound (`lo`) of our search range is `1` (the smallest possible distance).
   - The upper bound (`hi`) is `(position[n-1] - position[0]) / (m-1)`, which is the maximum possible minimum distance when placing `m` balls in `n` baskets.

3. **Placement Check**:
   - For each mid value in our binary search, we check if it is possible to place `m` balls such that the minimum distance between any two balls is at least `mid`.
   - We start by placing the first ball in the first basket and then attempt to place each subsequent ball in the next available basket that is at least `mid` distance away from the last placed ball.
   - If we successfully place all `m` balls, it means `mid` is a feasible distance, and we try for a larger distance. If not, we try a smaller distance.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Sorting the `position` array takes \\(O(n \\log n)\\).
  - Binary search involves \\(O(\\log((position[n-1] - position[0]) / (m-1)))\\) iterations.
  - Each iteration of binary search involves a linear scan through the baskets to check the feasibility, which takes \\(O(n)\\).
  - Combining these, the overall time complexity is \\(O(n \\log n + n \\log ((position[n-1] - position[0]) / (m-1)))\\).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \\(O(1)\\) as we are only using a few extra variables for binary search and placement check.

# Step by Step Explanation

### Explanation Using Tables

To explain the logic using tables, you can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Initial Setup and Sorting**:
   - Sort the `position` array.
   - Initialize `lo` and `hi` for binary search range.
   
2. **Binary Search**:
   - Perform binary search to find the maximum possible minimum distance.
   - For each `mid` value, check if it is possible to place `m` balls with at least `mid` distance apart.
   
3. **Placement Check**:
   - Traverse the `position` array to place balls.
   - Use a counter to count the number of balls placed and update the position of the last placed ball.
   - If the required number of balls are placed, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

| Step                | Description                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sort `position`     | Ensure the positions are in ascending order for easier placement checking.                                   |
| Initialize `lo`, `hi` | Set `lo` to 1 and `hi` to the maximum possible minimum distance `(position[n-1] - position[0]) / (m - 1)`.  |
| Binary Search       | Iterate until `lo` is less than or equal to `hi`. Calculate `mid` and check placement feasibility.            |
| Check Placement     | Start from the first position, place balls if the distance from the last placed ball is at least `mid`.       |
| Update Search Range | If placement is feasible, set `ans` to `mid` and move `lo` to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, move `hi` to `mid - 1`.  |
| Return Result       | The variable `ans` holds the maximum possible minimum distance after the search completes.                    |
